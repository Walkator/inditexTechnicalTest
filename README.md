# PruebaTecnicaInditex-iOS


The test has been carried out with the indications that have been previously given using a public API about Rick and Morty. I made the app as follows:
- I have used the MVP architecture that is easy to implement and gives us everything we need
- UserDefaults has been used for the persistence of the score that the user gives to each character.
- Character images have been natively cached to reduce the number of requests.
- I have added both a search engine and a filter to filter by rated characters.
- Tests have been carried out.
- Different call error handlers have been implemented.
- The assets used have been generated with Midjourney.
